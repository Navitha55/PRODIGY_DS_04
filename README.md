# Social Media Sentiment Analysis
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands

# Introduction
Social media platforms have become a significant source of public sentiment data. Analyzing this data can be valuable for businesses, researchers, and decision-makers to understand how people feel about their products, services, or specific topics. This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis and visualize the results.

# Initially...
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (>=3.6) installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries (you can install them using pip):
- pandas
- matplotlib
- textblob
pip install pandas matplotlib textblob
# Getting-Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone:(https://github.com/Navitha55/PRODIGY_DS_04/blob/main/PRODIGY_DS_04)

cd social-media-sentiment-analysis

2. Download or prepare your social media data in CSV format and save it in the project directory.

3. Open the Python code sentiment_analysis.py and set the text_column_name variable to the name of the column containing the text data in your CSV file.

4. Run the CODE :
python sentiment_analysis.py
The code will perform sentiment analysis on the provided data and generate visualizations.

# Usage
- Modify the analyze_sentiment and categorize_sentiment functions in sentiment_analysis.py if needed, to customize the sentiment analysis logic.
- Adjust the visualization settings, such as colors, labels, and plot sizes, in the script to suit your preferences.
# Results
The project generates two main types of visualizations:

1. Average Sentiment by Category Bar Chart: This chart displays the average sentiment polarity for each sentiment category (Positive, Negative, and Neutral). It provides a quick overview of the sentiment distribution within the data.
